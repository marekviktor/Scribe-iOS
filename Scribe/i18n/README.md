## Application text localization files for Scribe apps

**Scribe-i18n** is the home of the localization files that are included in each Scribe application.

> [!NOTE]\
> The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested.

Scribe apps are available on [iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), [Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) (planned) and [Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) (planned). For the data formatting processes see [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data) and for our data download API see [Scribe-Server](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data).

Check out Scribe's [architecture diagrams](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the organization including our applications, services and processes. It depicts the projects that [Scribe](https://github.com/scribe-org) is developing as well as the relationships between them and the external systems with which they interact.

# Setup [`â‡§`](#contents)

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repo, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-i18n.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) ðŸ”‘

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-i18n.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd Scribe-i18n
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (Scribe-i18n repository)

If all looks good, then you're ready to start localizing!

Those interested in helping can check the [`-next release-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/labels/-next%20release-) and [`-priority-`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/labels/-priority-) labels in the [issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues) for those that are most important, as well as those marked [`good first issue`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are tailored for first time contributors.

### Pull Requests [`â‡§`](#contents)

> [!NOTE]\
> Please [open an issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/issues/new) before setting out on a major localization so that the team is aware of what you're working on! If you don't let us know, you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the developers might not want to merge into the project. With that being said, major additions are very appreciated!

Good pull requests are the foundation of our community making Scribe-i18n. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. Note that all contributions to this project will be made under [the specified license](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-i18n/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) and should follow the code style standards ([contact us](https://matrix.to/#/#scribe_community:matrix.org) if unsure).

When making a contribution, adhering to the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) process is the best way to get your work merged:

1. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

2. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

3. Commit your changes in logical chunks, and please try to adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> [!NOTE]
> The following are tools and methods to help you write good commit messages âœ¨
>
> - [commitlint](https://commitlint.io/) helps write [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
> - Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase) cleans up commits

4. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

6. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!

### Road Map [`â‡§`](#contents)

The Scribe road map can be followed in the organization's [project board](https://github.com/orgs/scribe-org/projects/1) where we list the most important issues along with their priority, status and an indication of which sub projects they're included in (if applicable).

### Joining the Community [`â‡§`](#contents)

After your first few pull requests organization members would be happy to discuss granting you further rights as a contributor, with a maintainer role then being possible after continued interest in the project. Scribe seeks to be an inclusive and supportive organization. We'd love to have you on the team!
